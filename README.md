Tries and Suffix Tries
Overview
This repository contains implementations of Tries and Suffix Tries in [your programming language of choice]. Tries and Suffix Tries are fundamental data structures in computer science, particularly useful for string processing tasks such as searching for substrings, autocomplete, and text analysis.


Trie
A Trie (pronounced "try") is a tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings, where the keys are usually strings. Tries are used for efficient retrieval of keys in a dataset of strings. A common application of Tries is in autocomplete systems, spell checking, and IP routing.

Suffix Trie
A Suffix Trie is a specialized form of a Trie that stores all the suffixes of a given text. It is used to solve various string-related problems efficiently, such as finding the longest repeated substring, locating patterns within a text, and performing quick searches.
